# Zappy - Graphic
Epitech project

This is the graphical interface made with Unity for an EPITECH project: Zappy.
this interface is available for windows and linux and works with a server available only on linux.
(note that the linux version of the project wasn't tested very well, so there might be bugs)

the .dll / .so needed to run this application is a container for the network layer of the project
(For the project, the network layer HAD to be done in C)

I did not work on the server, neither on the AI, but i did the unity work by myself.
